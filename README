Simple and quick running installations

In order to run the api you need to install dotnet
To run it go into api/netcoreapp3.0/
and run
dotnet ./FAtiMAHTTPServer.dll 5000 ../scenario.json ../assets.json

The FAtiMa server should be up and running at port 5000

As mentioned, there is a CORS issue with the current version of the API
In order to bypass, corsproxy was used
https://www.npmjs.com/package/corsproxy


The UI application is the simple test application that was shown in the meeting
It expects the FAtiMa Api to be running at port 5000
and corsproxy to be running at port 1337

The UI requires node and npm to run (you might need to install vue.js, but the dependencies should sort that out)
After having installed node and npm
Go into ui/
and run 
npm install
so that the required node modules are installed

This should sort all of its dependencies
in order to run the ui
just go into ui/
and run
npm run serve

You can see examples of calls to the API in the file ui/src/components/ImpressNarrative.vue
